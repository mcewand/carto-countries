Countrify is a simple pair of stylesheets for DevelopmentSeed's TileMill.  

Use these to quickly style specific regions (e.g. I only want to show labels for and color Europe) by commenting out the labeled groups.  

Country names are provided as abbreviations above zoom level 5.  At all levels, every country label is visible and the labels are clickable.
